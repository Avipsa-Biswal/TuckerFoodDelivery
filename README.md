# TuckerFoodDelivery


Our innovative food delivery app goes beyond just delivering meals to your doorstep. We are proud to introduce a special feature called "Pledge" that aims to combat food waste and support underprivileged communities.

What is the Pledge Feature?
The Pledge feature is a community-driven initiative designed to ensure that unsold food items from local restaurants are not wasted but are instead redirected to those in need. Here's how it works:

Partnering with Local Restaurants: We collaborate with local restaurants that agree to donate their unsold food items at the end of each day.

Food Safety and Quality: The donated food is carefully checked to ensure it meets all safety and quality standards before being distributed.

Connecting with NGOs and Shelters: We partner with local NGOs and shelters to efficiently distribute the food to underprivileged individuals and families.

Pledge Donations: Users of our app can contribute to this cause by making a pledge donation. This can be done seamlessly through the app, where users can choose to donate a small amount while placing their orders.

Transparency and Updates: To maintain transparency, we provide regular updates on how the donations are being used, including stories and feedback from the beneficiaries.

Why Your Donation Matters
Reducing Food Waste: Millions of tons of food are wasted every year. By supporting the Pledge feature, you are actively contributing to reducing this waste.

Supporting the Underprivileged: Your donation ensures that underprivileged individuals have access to nutritious meals, making a significant impact on their daily lives.

Community Building: This initiative fosters a sense of community and responsibility, encouraging everyone to play a part in creating a more equitable society.

How to Make a Pledge
Order Food: When placing an order through our app, look for the Pledge option.

Choose Your Donation: Select the amount you wish to donate. Even a small contribution can make a big difference.

Complete Your Order: Proceed with your food order as usual. Your pledge donation will be added to the total amount.

Feel Good: Enjoy your meal knowing that you have helped provide for someone in need.

Join us in making a difference. Together, we can reduce food waste and support those who need it the most. Make a pledge today and be a part of this impactful journey!
